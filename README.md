# Student Mental Health - Machine Learning Project

This project analyzes a **Student Mental Health Survey** dataset to understand key factors affecting studentsâ€™ mental health and **predict depression levels** using **Logistic Regression** and **Decision Tree** models.  
It also provides **visual insights** into features like **CGPA, sleep, and stress-relief activities**.


##  Features

-  Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
  - Handles missing values and range conversions (CGPA, Sleep Hours)
  - Encodes categorical and multi-label stress relief activities
  - Normalizes numerical features
-  Data Visualization
  - Depression distribution
  - Correlation heatmap
  - CGPA vs Depression
  - Sleep patterns and top stress relief activities
-  Machine Learning
  - Logistic Regression for depression classification
  - Decision Tree visualization
-  Feature Selection
  - Selects top correlated features for model training
